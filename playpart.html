    <h4>Hedda Gabler Act 4-Henrik Ibsen</h4>
    <h5>MISS TESMAN.</h5>
    <p>Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister has at last found peace.</p>
     
    <h5>MISS TESMAN.</h5>
    <p>
    Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
    has at last found peace.
    </p>
    
    <h5>HEDDA.</h5>
    <p>
    I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.
    </p>
    
    <h5>MISS TESMAN.</h5>
    <p>
    Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
    Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
    death.
    </p>
    
    <h5>HEDDA.</h5>
    <p>
    That was very kind of you.
    </p>
    
    <h5>MISS TESMAN.</h5>
    <p>
    Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
    Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.
    </p>
    
    <h5>HEDDA.</h5>
    <p>
    [Changing the subject.] 
    </p>
    <p>She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
        Tesman?</p>
        
    <h5>MISS TESMAN.</h5>
    <p>
    Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
    happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
    not come home yet?
